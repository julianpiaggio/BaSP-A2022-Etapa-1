### Week
In this section, the content that is acquired will be uploaded and will be divided into weeks.

### Week 1 🕐
In the first week we worked in groups on how to design our pages from figma, giving a broader focus to the visual part of what our page would look like. We made a landing page, for which we designed 3 versions, these being for macbook, ipad and iphone.

### Week 2 🕐
In the second week we started to work with html individually, focusing on the creation of prototypes and the design of the page itself. The data used in week 1 was taken. It is important to highlight that the work with the styles has not yet started, that we will carry it out next week.

### Week 3 🕐
In the third week we work on how to apply styles to the design made previously by html. We apply different functions such as position, display, width, etc. We replicate the design created on the landing page with a css file.

### Week 4 🕐
In week 4 we work on responsive design to shape the landing page in different dimensions, allowing to have 3 specific views giving mobile, tablet and desktop. We worked with flexbox, which allowed us to mold the elements in a broader, more complete and verbose way than with css.

### Week 5 🕐
In week 5 we work with the principles of javascript. We start to create variables, the types of variables there are and the use of properties such as toUpperCasa, subString, etc. We did practical exercises on functions.

### Week 6 🕐
in week 6 we continue working with javascript, we got to know and work on the dom to create elements, modify them, validate forms for those data that the user needs to enter.

### Week 7 🕐
in week 7 we learned how to send requests to servers and receive responses from them. We also apply the use of promises and fetch for server responses. On the other hand, to save validations and then return them, we use the setItem and getItem properties of local storage.

### General info 📰
During this stage of the course, each week we will acquire the necessary theoretical and practical information to expand our knowledge in web development.

### Technologies in the project 🧪
The technologies applied so far are:

> ☑ HTML

> ☑ GIT

> ☑ GITHUB

> ☑ FIGMA

### Week
In this section, the content that is acquired will be uploaded and will be divided into weeks.

### Week 1 🕐
In the first week we worked in groups on how to design our pages from figma, giving a broader focus to the visual part of what our page would look like. We made a landing page, for which we designed 3 versions, these being for macbook, ipad and iphone.

### Week 2 🕐
In the second week we started to work with html individually, focusing on the creation of prototypes and the design of the page itself. The data used in week 1 was taken. It is important to highlight that the work with the styles has not yet started, that we will carry it out next week.
